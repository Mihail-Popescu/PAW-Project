## Overview
This project was developed for the "Proiectarea Aplicațiilor Web" (Web Application Design) course. It is the first fully-fledged web application I developed with the goal of learning about the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. The app simulates a telecom provider website, allowing users to browse and purchase services such as mobile phone plans, internet, and television packages.
## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:
- **Visual Studio 2022** (with the ASP.NET Core workload installed).
- **.NET 7 SDK** (you will be prompted to install it when loading the project if it’s not already installed).
- SQL Server LocalDB (for database storage).
